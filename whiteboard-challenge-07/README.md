#Problem Domain
Write a function which accepts a linked list as it's only argument, and returns true or false. - If the linked list is circular (it has no end), return true - Else return false

#Solution Domain
create and endless 'for' loop that circles through a linked list
when the for loop returns null, return a for loop to [0] and restart the process
make if statement to make sure it rturns error if it isnt an endless, circling linked list
Make sure it returns true if it is endless
